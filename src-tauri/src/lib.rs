//! AudioGraph — Real-time audio capture → transcription → knowledge graph
//!
//! This is the Tauri backend for the AudioGraph application.
//! Module structure:
//!   state     — AppState definition (Arc<Mutex<...>>)
//!   commands  — Tauri IPC command handlers
//!   events    — Event name constants and payload types
//!   audio     — Audio capture manager + processing pipeline
//!   asr       — Automatic speech recognition (whisper-rs)
//!   diarization — Speaker diarization (pyannote-rs)
//!   graph     — Temporal knowledge graph (petgraph)
//!   models    — Model management and downloading
